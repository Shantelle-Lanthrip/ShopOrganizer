# Shop Organizer

Android app built with `Jetpack Compose` with `Material 3` components. This app was a fun project to help me orgainze my personal shop of handmade items while as I touch on skills for `Jetpack Compose`.







## Current Features

Home Screen
- Displays a welcome header
- Displays shop item sections with a label (Crochet, Knitted, etc.) and shop items
- Each shop item has an image and title. When an item is clicked a `Toast` is displayed with the item's description.

Profile Screen
- Displays the shop's information (Logo, name, email, webiste, and location)

Bottom Navigation
- Displays a bottom navigation with two options (Home and Profile) and navigates to the selected choice





## Ongoing Development

I would like this application to be more customizable. Features I would like to add include:

- Login/create an account option
- Add/edit shop sections 
- Add/edit shop items
## Images/Information

All images and logos are my own that I use with my personal shop
